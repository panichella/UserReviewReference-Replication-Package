57290f67507c69054da8dfea,"Nice, but has some problems. Works fairly well. Most comic book archives open and preloading makes sure you can go through them quickly. Has a good amount of options to tweak your experience. One point deduction because it has some bugs and improvement points that have been around forever: I get errors on some archives, and I can never see the full error because it's always cut off (\\Can not open archive. This generally happens because ...\"\" Because what??). The main menu always shows the logo in big,  and then the last two archives opened. There's so much more you can do with this space.
