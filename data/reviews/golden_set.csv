Easiest solution out there: Download a program like (ComicRack) for windows or mac, find your CBR file in the program by using their explorer, right click the file, choose Export Books, then select convert file to CBZ. CBZ files are working fine. no error. There is another solution where you extract the image files from the CBR file by converting it to a regular ZIP file (warning, it's not as simple as changing the extesion to .zip, that will break the file, use ""Calibre"" or another program), the ComicRack way requires less time, and you can select multiple files to convert at once.

However, I quickly realized just how when I went in search of a calculator that is enhanced for Android Wear. This calculator is the perfect answer for my needs, with a full-featured Wear app. It is clean, simple, uncluttered and similar to the stock/AOSP calculator app. The difference is in the expanded features, which are tucked nicely behind a few simple gestures.

Option, I don't enjoy new bubble type left/right post/reply layout, provide options including the previous all left&plain text style. OneUp it by doing a custom tunable styling options feature! Miss the red notice icon. Even so, best xmpp app by far! Just found VIP Version and will 'upgrade' soon. Copy/Quote works! But resuming from notification no longer respawns in the previous chat room, it always goes to main screen :( mwaa",Ryan Fulcher,26/07/15,3,OTHER,PRICING,UI,LICENSING,,,,

57893aac819cb7066ab3fe18,Xabber,1.0.30,"My personal favorite XMPP+OTR app for Android, aside from a few minor issues I've had but have been able to solve. It allows for a large amount of customization for more advanced users while still remaining straightforward and simple to use for less advanced users. For the record, I've tried ChatSecure and Conversations too, but ChatSecure seems buggy and doesn't offer the option to not log conversations and Conversations has an issue where every time it disconnects, it gets stuck trying to load my contact list until I kill it and open it again.",Cinos Modnar,27/06/16,5,PROBLEM_DISCOVERY,RESSOURCES,APP USABILITY,,,y,,
