5729bda2507c690b8e0bd1a4,KEYBOARD Useless with a physical (eg bluetooth) keyboard because you can't use the shift key to type symbols. I can't imagine how anyone could use it seriously without that working. Not everybody wants to use the onscreen symbol bar.,1,1
5729bf52507c690b8e0bd34a,A little bit inconsistent Doesn't work reliably with my GS7 edge. I wanted to turn off AOD and use this but it doesn't have an always on mode. Please consider adding,0,1

5729be16507c690b8e0bd216,"Solid, usable app Good twitter app with all the features you'd want in an app. Like others the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that the UI is dated, but I still use it on my tablet as my primary twitter app",1,0
5729c03e507c690b8e0bd418,Not consistent I wanted to like it. I like the simple interface but the problem is that this works randomly sometimes I saw it sometimes I didn't. It would constantly go from this to my normal lock screen.,0,1

5789497a819cb706b00a7782,"Fine Nice app for anime lovers, I even told my friends about this app and posted on fb. There are a few problems though. Like when I put anime pictures to favorites and after that download them, I can't see there details like resolution and categories which is very important for me. It shows only 2 options, save as or wallpaper. It will be great if you people do something about this. And other thing is that the app force closes sometimes when I click on any image to open it.

At times there is huge latency in delivering messages. An hour or more delay is not acceptable when coordinating with people about time-sensitive matters. Fix these problems that arose during twitter ownership and add tablet support, syncing, group messaging, and self-destruct please. Keep it open source on top of that and I'll give the app 5 stars.",1,0

5729be6e507c690b8e0bd252,Please fix this Love the app but why can i should i have to sacrifice the clock and other basic lock screen items for a widget wgy cant i have the clock displayed and the widget below it. And there is a glitch or maybe its purposely if u double press the home key (i guess it works only in phones with a solid home key like samsung not the touch) your this will bypass the ac display.i.e. if no security is enabled (e.g.pattern) u can unlock your phone by double pressing the home key instead of swiping,1,1
