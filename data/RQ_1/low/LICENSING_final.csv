5729bf2a507c690b8e0bd327,"Pretty great lockscreen replacement for AMOLED screensâ€”especially on a Samsung (because their lockscreen is clunky garbage). There are just a few small changes that would make a WORLD of improvement, IMO, such as allowing more than one widget (there's plenty of space, why limit it?), allowing widgets to be wider (again, the space is there, why the limit?), being able to have widgets without overriding the stock clock, and being able to reposition the clock/widgets and maybe notification icons too. Also, custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly, an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too.",0,1

The playback stalls and freezes and plays intermittently, and won't allow me to 'come out' of the episode. The only way to do this is to close the app itself and open it again.
