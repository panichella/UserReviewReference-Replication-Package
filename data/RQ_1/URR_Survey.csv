"2016/10/07 1:51:58 pm EET","Useful","Somewhat difficult","Agree","75% of the time","Moderately Important","","Important","Nowadays the stores have such a huge number of apps for pretty everything, so a pleasant and intuitive UI could make an app stick out from the crowd","Moderately Important","Too much lags and freezes could dramatically decrease the user experience","Slightly Important","I think that the most part of users would like to have a free app (especially in the Android market), while they don't bother about the open source philosophy ","Slightly Important","I think that few users (the more ""conscious"" ones) take care about protection issues","","Very important","I think it is very important because it includes the app weaknesses which are more visible to the users, so more directly involved in the rating that they usually assign to the app","Slightly Important","In this kind of review could be difficult to understand if a given problem is specific only for that device","Moderately Important","It is important for an app to be continuous updated in order to continue to work good in new s.o. releases; also the support of the most part of Android versions (which typically is a very fragmented os) is important to reach a large portions of users","Moderately Important","","Important","A good usability is a very useful indicator of the quality of an app nowadays ","Very important","A bug or a problem in a UI element, like a button, is noticed immediately by the users and affects directly the user experience","Very important","The good performances of an app (fast, no lags) increase dramatically the user experience, so they are a very important quality indicator","Important","Nowadays the smartphone are very powerful but most of them continue to lack of battery","Moderately Important","Lately, the trend for smartphone manufacturers is to remove the memory expansion through SD cards (in particular on top of range devices), so the memory is a precious resource for users","Slightly Important","Users do not bother about open source and typically they prefer the free versions (this aspect is particularly true in the Android market, while in the Apple one the users are more willing to pay for a pro version)","Moderately Important","Free apps are the more popular ones and typically the users are more likely to forgive little defects while they do not have to pay","Slightly Important"," As said for the high level category, typically few users bother about protection","Very important","Few users take care about privacy typically","No","","The classification of some reviews concerning RAM or CPU usage is a little bit ambiguous; for example, a review like the following ""RAM Sucker This tiny app reduces my over 500 mb RAM to below 200. Deleting"" should be included in hardware evaluation or in performance? I think that ""data usage"" could be another low level category under Resources."
