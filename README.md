# Replication Package for the paper entitled: "Analyzing Reviews and Code of Mobile Apps for a better Release Planning Organization".

Abstract:
The mobile apps market experiences an unprecedented high growth, developers working in this context face a fierce competition in 
acquiring and retaining users. They have to quickly implement new features and fix bugs, or risks losing their users to the 
competition. The only way for them to achieve this goal is by closely monitoring the user feedback they receive in form of user 
reviews. However, successful apps can receive up to several thousands of reviews per day,  manually analysing each of them is a 
time consuming task. To help developers deal with the large amount of information, we have developed a novel approach, called 
URR (User Request Referencer), that is able to organise reviews according to predefined fine grained maintenance and evolution 
tasks (battery, performance, memory, privacy, etc.) and recommend the related source code artifacts. We evaluated our approach 
through an empirical study involving the reviews and code of 39 mobile applications. Our results show a high precision and 
recall of URR in organising reviews according to well defined maintenance and evolution tasks and recommending the source files
that need to be modified to handle the issues raised by users in their reviews. Finally, while evaluating our approach we 
discovered that using code structure information of mobile applications   improves code localization results.

This repository provides the replication package with (i) material and working data sets of our study, (ii) complete results of the SURVEY; and (iii) rawdata for replication purposes and to support future studies. A detailed description of the contents is included in README.txt.
