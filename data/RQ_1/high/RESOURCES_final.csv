57291dc0507c69054da8ee64,Fantastic way to view wallpaper! I've been using this app for over 2 years on Samsung and Motorola devices with absolutely no problems. Just remember to configure Your launcher (I use Nova Prime) to Muzei so all you have to do is double tap your screen to change images or adjust your settings. This app allows lots of customization options. Muzei also has endless extensions so you will never be bored with the same old photos again. I've experienced no major battery drain and no bugs. Highly recommended!,1,1
