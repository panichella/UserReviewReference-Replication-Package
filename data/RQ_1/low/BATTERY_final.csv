5729c317507c690b8e0bd705,"Hands down. Amazing App! I was having major battery drain issues. Using OS monitor, I was able to narrow it down to Google Play Services. I turned off sync location and all of a sudden CPU usage dropped to nothing. Upon restarting location services, CPU usage stayed low. But once I re-enabled sync I saw CPU usage jump back up to ~20%. That's when I knew where my issue was. I would have been lost without this app!",1,1

5729186a507c69054da8e926,"Great app but there is a character limit. Great for privacy and instant messaging. Ive gotten a few friends on board so its great for messaging them but also for regular texting. One complaint. I learned there was a character limit the hard way. Took me 23 minutes to type a story to my friend and it's all done and finished. But when I sent it, it only sent half of what I typed. It would have been better if it stopped letting me type when this limit was reached.",0,1
