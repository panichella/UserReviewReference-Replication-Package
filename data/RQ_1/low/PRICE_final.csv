572913ab507c69054da8e4d3,"Too difficult for my tastes. I'm an avid gamer who likes a challenge now and again, but this game is challenging on an aggravating level. Health loss is common and unavoidable, scarce healing resources, hunger/ starvation comes on too quickly, scarce food resources, potions and scrolls are a crap-shoot so there is no way to strategize their use, and also permadeath. This game is kind of set up for you to lose. I enjoyed the other aspects though.",0,1
