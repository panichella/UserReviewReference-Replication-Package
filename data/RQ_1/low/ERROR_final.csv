57291323507c69054da8e440,"Great app! May be due for an update I've been using this app for months, and it's been fantastic. The color-matching backgrounds make having non-abstract wallpapers viable, without the need for weird cropping. I use a Samsung s note, not sure which model. Recently downloaded a system update that seems to have messed up the app a bit. The background just says \"screen 1: picture is unavailable. Need to setup or reload.\" I've tried restarting, and I double checked the location for my wallpapers, and the screen is still there. I hope this gets fixed soon! I don't think I'll be able to find another app that works this well!",1,1

572912b5507c69054da8e3e2,ralph9250 I was very disappointed. I had a old Samsung Infuse and the application worked great. I had 3000+ pictures and they rotated between the 7 screens. A different picture on each screen. I had that phone for almost 3 years. This year I treated myself for Christmas and bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I am so disappointed because I cannot get the application to switch pictures when I change screens. I read in your report that this seems to be a problem with the Galaxy S series. FIX IT!,1,1
