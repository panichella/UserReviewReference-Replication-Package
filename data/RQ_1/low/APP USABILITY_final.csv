Improving the following would make me change back to ****. -- App is unable to filter transactions. ---- This means I am unable to show transactions from only 1 account. -- There is no option to transfer a balance. ---- This would come in handy when paying off a credit card. I currently have to do this as two separate transactions. -- App is unable to set up repeating payments. ---- This would be useful for recurring monthly bills.This also means I can't use the app as a bill reminder. >>Adding the following idea as well would make it a ***** app for me. -- An option for shared accounts to be updated from multiple devices. ---- This can possibly be done through text messaging from the app. The shared account will have a phone number on file. When the account is updated the app will send a text to that phone number. When the text message is received, the app can be running in the background, and update itself based on info in the text message.

This was obvious for acknowledgement after only 5 mins for my part. 2) You offer all functions in the free version  3) You ask for donation, but only to support you, not to unlock extra features, as they are already available in the free version. 4) The application does NOT take a lot of memory = it's a small size.  5) Simply, you have made a very nice looking interface and very easy to access from the drop-down menu at the top of screen. THANK YOU. In my head it yields: \"Make it work, but keep it simple\", which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service. Hence I donated the highest possible amount you've made available. Respect for you \"guys\". I will of course rate you on Google play store.  Yasemin Nielsen, Denmark/Norway",1,1
