57291435507c69054da8e54f,"Amazing game I have had this game on three different devices and played it for almost two years. I have beaten it with the Warrior, the Mage, and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes, the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low, or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level, and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise.

57291974507c69054da8ea06,"I am completely lost as to why this app gets so many good reviews, because for me, it is AWFUL - at least as far as custom decks are concerned. It is far too over-complicated. Bear witness. Even trying to explain why it is so terrible will be confusing, and then bear in mind, working with the app is even worse. For example, it totally tries to own when and what I can study. It disappears my cards if it thinks I have studied them enough, forcing me to go and figure out how to put them back into the study session based on how many days to advance my \"review\" session. If I want to set up a custom study session to force it to allow me to study what I want, when I want, again it disappears the original deck - where I can no longer \"browse\" my list of cards, which btw, I have to do whenever I want to see a custom field because the app does not make it easy to add the field to the study deck. If none of this makes sense, then you are in the same boat I am in â€“ only hopefully you havenâ€™t put time and effort into creating a custom deck with this (cr)app.",0,1

Has a good amount of options to tweak your experience. One point deduction because it has some bugs and improvement points that have been around forever: I get errors on some archives, and I can never see the full error because it's always cut off (\"Can not open archive. This generally happens because ...\" Because what??). The main menu always shows the logo in big, and then the last two archives opened. There's so much more you can do with this space.

5729c178507c690b8e0bd554,"Clip Stack surely does the job it proclaims to execute. However, there isn't much value in the application because a typical \"Notepad\" application pretty much does the same job if you wish for text and other media like a file. It would have been awesome if the contextual clipboard is presented with the option to pick up the values from \"Clip Stack\". For instance, I navigate to a website and would want to paste multiple values in the text fields designated. If I attempt to copy a value from Clip Stack app and then navigate back to the website to paste those values, it would take me a lot of time. Instead of that, WHAT IF soon after I long-press on the field, it presents with the option to paste content from the clipboard as well as present me a snapshot of values from \"Clip Stack\", which way I should have attempted to pick and paste one of the values from the application. This would be more intuitive. Not sure whether Android provides us a way to achieve it. But, such a feature would have truly been awesome instead of the existing features. Application design surely is commendable. But, unless the aforementioned feature has been added, we would not be finding it usable.",1,1
