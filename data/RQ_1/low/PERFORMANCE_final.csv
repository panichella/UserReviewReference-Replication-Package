57894bcd819cb706b00a7a02,Classy - but not secure Battery friendly and simple. This is ideal if you're looking to keep your phone looking light and modern. Kudos to the devs. Edit : Hope the devs will address this problem. As of late the Lock screen doesn't turn off if I get a notification. I've set it to turn off five seconds after I get a notification but it doesn't. It will show the display and time without switching off which can be quite annoying when youre in bed and get a notification that makes the display light up all night.,1,0

Non solo Ã¨ software libero (licenza Apache 2), ma Ã¨ stato semplicissimo connettermi al mio irssi dentro uno screen: * la gestione della mia chiave Ã¨ intuitiva, posso inserire la passphrase una volta e per un po' la ricorda (alla ssh-add), ma non se sono molte ore che non la uso; * il beep ha funzionato subito nel modo che volevo io, configurazione facilissima; * la micro-tastiera virtuale Ã¨ facile da far comparire e ha tutto quello che mi serve, in particolare \"esc\" per dare comandi a irssi; nell'ultimo aggiornamento anche tab e le frecce. Peccato che ci sia solo ssh e non mosh: mantenere la connessione in treno o autostrada Ã¨ un'impresa.
