CBZ files are working fine. no error. There is another solution where you extract the image files from the CBR file by converting it to a regular ZIP file (warning, it's not as simple as changing the extesion to .zip, that will break the file, use ""Calibre"" or another program), the ComicRack way requires less time, and you can select multiple files to convert at once.

57291692507c69054da8e715,Bubble level,02/01/02,I figured out a way to calibrate it! Take a piece of foam larger than your phone/tablet. (I used 1"""" Styrofoam insulation) Float the foam in a bowl or your sink full of water. Place your phone on top of the foam and wait until it stops moving.......press calibrate. It should be fairly accurate at that point. I have a Samsung S2x with a battery that bulges out at the back and it was the only way I could figure out how to get level with it. Simple but useful app. Thanks.

However, there isn't much value in the application because a typical ""Notepad"" application pretty much does the same job if you wish for text and other media like a file. It would have been awesome if the contextual clipboard is presented with the option to pick up the values from ""Clip Stack"". For instance, I navigate to a website and would want to paste multiple values in the text fields designated. If I attempt to copy a value from Clip Stack app and then navigate back to the website to paste those values, it would take me a lot of time. Instead of that, WHAT IF soon after I long-press on the field, it presents with the option to paste content from the clipboard as well as present me a snapshot of values from ""Clip Stack"", which way I should have attempted to pick and paste one of the values from the application. This would be more intuitive. Not sure whether Android provides us a way to achieve it. But, such a feature would have truly been awesome instead of the existing features.

5729c1d9507c690b8e0bd5a2,ConnectBot,01/08/06,Great App I use this to connect to compute servers primarily to monitor jobs. One improvement I'd suggest is better screen management with landscape orientation. It's difficult to use vi or sed to edit scripts with a touch phone keyboard that hogs half the screen space. I don't think the screen can be scrolled but maybe I didn't figure out how. Public key management works well.

Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3, and it's one of my favorite Android features.

57291a6e507c69054da8eb0b,Financius - Expense Manager,0.19.7,"I used Financius for about a year and a half, replacing Spendee. Financius was the best expense manager that I had seen during the time I was using it. Once I encountered another app called Expense Manager, it became a tossup on which one was better. Financius offers a better UI and reporting, while Expense Manager offers decent reporting with meh UI, but most importantly I think, Expense Manager has widgets to quick-add expenses, while Financius does not. To put that in perspective, using Expense Manager, i have my 8 most used categories on a homescreen, tap one it brings up a expense entry screen, selecting the category. I enter an amount and hit submit. Financius requires me to start the app, hit new transaction, enter an amount, select category, select tags (if applicable) and then submit. So I prefer Financius for the reporting and UI, but Expense Manager for the functionality.

It also will not let you set the position for wallpapers larger than your display, and there isn't a setting to enable the ""moving background"" that is standard on Android for normal wallpapers. Many of the transitions do not work; many of them occurred even when moving between different pages of my home screen that had the same settings. Crossfade didn't work when unlocking my phone. The wallpaper faded to black and then faded the new wallpaper in. This would probably be acceptable if the animation was in any way smooth.

Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low, or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level, and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise.

The receiver can call me back or sms back at my old number.... That's weird.... Probably if I uninstall/re-install the app it could be fixed but i haven't try yet.

This apps looks great, but as yet, I have been unable to connect to any chat servers! Which, kind of defeats the object of having the app. I am a syadmin for a chat server and if I cannot get my app connected to my own server, then something is very wrong. I have triple checked the settings, watched the ejabberd server logs, but this app just refuses to connect - probably something to do with the server certificate, but I have tried all combinations of the app security options and still no joy.
