CBZ files are working fine. no error. There is another solution where you extract the image files from the CBR file by converting it to a regular ZIP file (warning, it's not as simple as changing the extesion to .zip, that will break the file, use ""Calibre"" or another program), the ComicRack way requires less time, and you can select multiple files to convert at once.

It is far too over-complicated. Bear witness. Even trying to explain why it is so terrible will be confusing, and then bear in mind, working with the app is even worse. For example, it totally tries to own when and what I can study. It disappears my cards if it thinks I have studied them enough, forcing me to go and figure out how to put them back into the study session based on how many days to advance my ""review"" session. If I want to set up a custom study session to force it to allow me to study what I want, when I want, again it disappears the original deck - where I can no longer ""browse"" my list of cards, which btw, I have to do whenever I want to see a custom field because the app does not make it easy to add the field to the study deck.

However, there isn't much value in the application because a typical ""Notepad"" application pretty much does the same job if you wish for text and other media like a file. It would have been awesome if the contextual clipboard is presented with the option to pick up the values from ""Clip Stack"". For instance, I navigate to a website and would want to paste multiple values in the text fields designated. If I attempt to copy a value from Clip Stack app and then navigate back to the website to paste those values, it would take me a lot of time. Instead of that, WHAT IF soon after I long-press on the field, it presents with the option to paste content from the clipboard as well as present me a snapshot of values from ""Clip Stack"", which way I should have attempted to pick and paste one of the values from the application. This would be more intuitive. Not sure whether Android provides us a way to achieve it. But, such a feature would have truly been awesome instead of the existing features.

THANK YOU. In my head it yields: ""Make it work, but keep it simple"", which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service.

Financius was the best expense manager that I had seen during the time I was using it. Once I encountered another app called Expense Manager, it became a tossup on which one was better. Financius offers a better UI and reporting, while Expense Manager offers decent reporting with meh UI, but most importantly I think, Expense Manager has widgets to quick-add expenses, while Financius does not. To put that in perspective, using Expense Manager, i have my 8 most used categories on a homescreen, tap one it brings up a expense entry screen, selecting the category. I enter an amount and hit submit. Financius requires me to start the app, hit new transaction, enter an amount, select category, select tags (if applicable) and then submit. So I prefer Financius for the reporting and UI, but Expense Manager for the functionality. If Financius were to add widgets, it would reign supreme for me again.",Ryan L,24/12/15,4,OTHER,,,,,,"[""USAGE""]","[""UI""]",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

572912c9507c69054da8e3f9,MultiPicture Live Wallpaper,0.6.11,"Does as it says, but not well To get a single picture to work correctly, you have to manually navigate (using an installed file explorer) to where that picture is located instead of using the built in selection. It also will not let you set the position for wallpapers larger than your display, and there isn't a setting to enable the ""moving background"" that is standard on Android for normal wallpapers. Many of the transitions do not work; many of them occurred even when moving between different pages of my home screen that had the same settings. Crossfade didn't work when unlocking my phone. The wallpaper faded to black and then faded the new wallpaper in. This would probably be acceptable if the animation was in any way smooth. In summary, this app has some neat features that ""work,"" but some of them don't work and the ones that do never seem to work well. Didn't use it long enough to see if it impacts battery life.

57291dc0507c69054da8ee64,Muzei Live Wallpaper,02/01/01,Fantastic way to view wallpaper! I've been using this app for over 2 years on Samsung and Motorola devices with absolutely no problems. Just remember to configure Your launcher (I use Nova Prime) to Muzei so all you have to do is double tap your screen to change images or adjust your settings. This app allows lots of customization options. Muzei also has endless extensions so you will never be bored with the same old photos again. I've experienced no major battery drain and no bugs.

I have beaten it with the Warrior, the Mage, and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes, the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low, or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level, and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise.

Random dungeon generation makes repeat plays fresh and is very repayable. Bad: The randomness of weapon/armor drops make it difficult to get past some of the early stages, especially if the ghost side quest provides minimal value.
