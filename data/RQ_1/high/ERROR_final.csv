Ex.: 'study' would be more clear, obvious and accurate than 'review'. Review means to see again. It implies the material has been seen before and is a more cursory exposure to the material. I also can't remember where various features are: must search endlessly. Too complicated to learn. Descriptions too technical,nerdy.Optional pop-ups would help.",0,1
